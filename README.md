# Time-series
The problem is to predict mid-span strain of a concrete beam. The dataset provides a time series mid-span strain from 16:59:01 to 17:10:55, or 716 seconds of data. The values are in the units of microstrain (µε), and there are 716 observations. The dataset is obtained by experimental testing.
